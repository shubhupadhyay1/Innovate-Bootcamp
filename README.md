# Innovate-Bootcamp
With COVID-19 locking everyone in their homes, going about your daily activities has become a mundane and prosaic chore. More so with to-do lists.
Even under ordinary circumstances, to-do lists stare in our faces as the pile of incomplete tasks gets bigger.

So, the need for a to-do list that makes this a social activity was needed as it would surround you with people thaat motivate you.
This is a basic to-do list that lets you add or delete tasks made using the tkinter library.

To make it into a group collaboratory project, you need to be able to do the following:
1) Share your lists with your friends that allows them to view it,
2) Have a separate window for your lists where both persons can modify it,
3) Open applications like Whatsapp, Facetime or Google Meet to be able to work together on a video call
4) Open recreational applications like Spotify or Netflix that may not be good for productivity, but are required to stay sane
